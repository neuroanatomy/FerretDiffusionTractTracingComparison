### scripts
#### data processing
scripts for the preprocessing and processing of the diffusion data
as well as for generating and normalizing the connectivity matrices.
for more details see readme.txt

#### data analysis
scripts for the computation of the correlations between the diffusion data and the tract-tracing data
as well as the different tests presented in the paper.
for more details see readme.txt

### data
connectivity matrices from diffusion tractography
for 6 tracttography pipelines: DTI, CSD and msmt CSD using deterministic and probabilistic tractography. Tractography performed with MRtrix3 (https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
tract-tracing data used from (Dell et al, 2018) on the ferret brain connectivity of the occipital (https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24631), temporal (https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24632) and posterior parietal cortices (https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24630).
